# BachelorProject
Name still in works.
This repository will encompass all code required for my bachelor project regarding: *Modifying Kotlin Source Code: A Comparison of a Compiler-Plugin-based Approach and an Agent-based Approach*

The project includes a quick and dirty Proof of Concept (PoC), which traces self time of functions, for both approaches and can be found in **poc**.
The heart of the thesis is included in **invariants** which offers an annotation to validate variables during runtime
